If you’re using the GitHub website

Go to the repository you want to delete.

Example: https://github.com/username/repository-name

Click the ⚙️ “Settings” tab (on the right side of the repository menu).

Scroll all the way down to the “Danger Zone” section.

Find “Delete this repository” and click the Delete this repository button.

GitHub will ask you to:

Type the repository name (e.g., username/repository-name) to confirm.

Click the “I understand the consequences, delete this repository” button.

Done — the repository is permanently deleted.
